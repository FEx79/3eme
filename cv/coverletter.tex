I am writing to apply for the Erasmus Program for my third year in Computer Science
at \og La Province de Li\`ege Higher Education Institution \fg. 
My aim is to seek a Master's degree in Computer Science and then, to work in game development.
The stage offered by your company would be a good preparation towards this aim.

My greatest desire would be to integrate a motivated
development team in the field of video game development
and your stage offer seem to be exactly what I'm looking for.

I practice programming for roughly 7 years. Since then,
I have experienced a lot of different techniques and language like
Python, C/C++, C\#, Java, PHP, Ajax. I also had the opportunity to develop a lot
of different projects in various areas like image processing, real-time processing,
game and website. Some of them were developed in a team. I am confident that my
educational background is in keeping with your requirements.

I am highly motivated, hardworking and reliable, and I would particularly
welcome the opportunity to work in a motivated team in the field of game development.
I am confident that your team will benefit both from my enthusiasm and my abilities.

I hope you will view my application favorably and I look forward to hearing from you.
I can be reached at this email address \href{mailto:thomasvangysegem@gmail.com}{thomasvangysegem@gmail.com}
